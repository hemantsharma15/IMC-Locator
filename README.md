# Problem statement 
Indore residents face significant challenges when attempting to locate the exact offices of various IMC departments. This lack of easily accessible information leads to confusion, wasted time, and frustration among citizens. Current methods for finding office locations are inefficient and outdated, often resulting in unnecessary delays and inefficiencies in accessing municipalÂ services.

# Solution

# IMC Office Locator Website

This project is a website for indicating 
the locations of various departments of the Indore Municipal Corporation. It provides information such as office floor Address, locations, and current status, with a link to Google Maps for each department location.
